## A random note to self

I have a weird relationship with my belongings. I don't like to own two similar
objects, with the exception of clothes. When I buy something I already have,
the old one _has_ to go. I do this thinking it will help reduce the anxiety
surrounding this aspect of my life. I have been struggling every time a move
comes up, this usually involves flying back home from school abroad, or
simply just packing up alone. I hate possessions, I hate going through them
and feeling wasteful if I throw them away, I try to donate or sell them, but
sometimes this is not always possible.
