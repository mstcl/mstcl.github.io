<p>I was <em>mildly</em> content with entering my LUKS2 password every time I have to reboot my computer. Even though it is quite a complicated password, I got used to it; moreover, I rarely restarted anyway (at most once a day for important updates). However, I am facing a possibility of going without my keyboard for a bit (some days to some weeks). As I planned on using my laptop as a keyboard (not sure how this is going to play out, a post on that in the near future), I knew for sure any setup wouldn&rsquo;t work if I am prompted for a decryption password.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-autologin">Enabling autologin</h2>
<p>First, I had to disable <code>lightdm</code> greeter. I only run <code>i3wm</code>, and it is superfluous to login that way. I plan to turn it on once I reunite with a working keyboard for an extra layer of security to prevent cold boot attacks.</p>
<p>To enable autologin in <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code>, these two lines need to be present under the <code>[Seat]</code> option:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"># /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
[Seat:*]
autologin-user=&lt;username&gt;
autologin-user-timeout=0
</code></pre></div><p>After that, the group <code>autologin</code> needs to be created, and the autologin user added to it. In the shell:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo gpasswd -a lckdscl autologin
sudo groupadd -r autologin
</code></pre></div><p><del>d</del>
The default session must also be set in <code>~/.dmrc</code>. Once all of that is done, then autologin should work.</p>
<h2 id="arch-wiki-comes-to-the-rescue">Arch wiki comes to the rescue</h2>
<p>I looked through many guides for enabling TPM2 for Linux, and unsurprisingly, nothing beats the information from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Platform_Module#systemd-cryptenroll">this</a> Arch wiki page. All the information just works. I needed to install <code>tpm2-tools</code>, <code>tpm2-tss</code>, <code>tpm2-abrmd</code>. Then <code>systemd-cryptenroll</code> recognised my TPM2 device right away.</p>
<p>The information around adding kernel options so that systemd can mount root after decrypting it is a bit confusing, so I went with making a <code>/etc/crypttab.initramfs</code> file instead. This worked flawlessly.</p>
<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure boot?</h2>
<p>I only registered to PCR0, since my kernel and bootloader, and kernel modules are not signed. Enabling secure boot would be a pain with some dkms modules. Maybe one day I will sit down and enable secure boot.</p>
<h2 id="goodbye-plymouth">Goodbye plymouth</h2>
<p>With TPM2 unlocking my drive pleasantly, I didn&rsquo;t have the need for <code>plymouth</code> and its themes. I set the kernel on low verbosity and quiet options, so once I hit the boot button, I just have to wait about 30s until I see my familiar riced i3 desktop.</p>
