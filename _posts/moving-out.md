## Note to self
__moving date (17/07)__ what's a sane order? I would say "other bits" first, obviously leaving the pc + monitor + peripherals until the day before but most clothes can be packed 3/4 days after a final laundry load (or I could just honestly wait to do laundry at the new place to save some dough)

* [x] the boxes
    * [x] monitor (I wouldn't put other things in)
    * [x] ~~speakers + other bits~~
    * [x] ~~rice-cooker + other bits~~
    * [x] pc
    * [x] leftover pantry items + other bits
    * [x] cookware + cutlery + other bits
    * [x] beddings
* [x] the suitcases
    * [x] un: clothes (!)
    * [x] deux: filled to the brim
* [x] the bags
    * [x] bagpack
    * [x] duffel bag
    * [x] futon blankets
* [ ] additional: [declutter]({{< relref declutter >}}) before the move
