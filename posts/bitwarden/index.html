<li>I sucesfully setup a docker container that is self-hosting bitwarden locally. I cannot expose the server so locally should be ideal still since I&rsquo;m not going out as much or doing anything which requires instantaneous syncing.</li>
<li>my passwords now contain a single point of failure, and that is my physical computer, if anything were to happen to the data on my nvme, then my passwords are screwed</li>

<h2 id="resources">resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>I used <a href="https://theselfhostingblog.com/posts/how-to-self-host-bitwarden-on-ubuntu-server/">this</a> to setup the local server (obviously skipping the nginx public access part)</li>
