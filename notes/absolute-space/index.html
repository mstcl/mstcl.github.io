<ul>
<li>motion of a body is a change of relation to the bodies that surround it.</li>
<li>concept of inertia
<ul>
<li>a body&rsquo;s motion will be preserved unless caused to deviate from its path</li>
<li>so not a function of its spatial relations to other bodies but of its causal relation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-newtonian-body">The Newtonian body</h2>
<ul>
<li>a body&rsquo;s motion is not a function of its spatial relations to other objects but rather of whether forces are impressed on it.</li>
<li>disagreement with Descartes:
<ul>
<li>a body&rsquo;s true motion is not only a relative change or a perceptive change, it is a body&rsquo;s change of position within space itself</li>
<li>this means a body&rsquo;s motion of all types should be understood as absolute motion</li>
<li>therefore the mathematical idea of space must be shared amongst all objects in the universe, <em>independent</em> of any objects and their relations
<ul>
<li>this is the concept of <em>absolute space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
