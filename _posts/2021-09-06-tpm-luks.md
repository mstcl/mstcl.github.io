## Motivation

I was _mildly_ content with entering my LUKS2 password every time I have to reboot my computer. Even though it is quite a complicated password, I got used to it; moreover, I rarely restarted anyway (at most once a day for important updates). However, I am facing a possibility of going without my keyboard for a bit (some days to some weeks). As I planned on using my laptop as a keyboard (not sure how this is going to play out, a post on that in the near future), I knew for sure any setup wouldn't work if I am prompted for a decryption password.

## Enabling autologin

First, I had to disable `lightdm` greeter. I only run `i3wm`, and it is superfluous to login that way. I plan to turn it on once I reunite with a working keyboard for an extra layer of security to prevent cold boot attacks.

To enable autologin in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`, these two lines need to be present under the `[Seat]` option:

```conf
# /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
[Seat:*]
autologin-user=<username>
autologin-user-timeout=0
```

After that, the group `autologin` needs to be created, and the autologin user added to it. In the shell:

```bash
sudo gpasswd -a lckdscl autologin
sudo groupadd -r autologin
```

~~d~~
The default session must also be set in `~/.dmrc`. Once all of that is done, then autologin should work.

## Arch wiki comes to the rescue

I looked through many guides for enabling TPM2 for Linux, and unsurprisingly, nothing beats the information from [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Platform_Module#systemd-cryptenroll) Arch wiki page. All the information just works. I needed to install `tpm2-tools`, `tpm2-tss`, `tpm2-abrmd`. Then `systemd-cryptenroll` recognised my TPM2 device right away.

The information around adding kernel options so that systemd can mount root after decrypting it is a bit confusing, so I went with making a `/etc/crypttab.initramfs` file instead. This worked flawlessly.

## Secure boot?

I only registered to PCR0, since my kernel and bootloader, and kernel modules are not signed. Enabling secure boot would be a pain with some dkms modules. Maybe one day I will sit down and enable secure boot.

## Goodbye plymouth

With TPM2 unlocking my drive pleasantly, I didn't have the need for `plymouth` and its themes. I set the kernel on low verbosity and quiet options, so once I hit the boot button, I just have to wait about 30s until I see my familiar riced i3 desktop.
