<p>Maybe it will help reduce the anxiety surrounding this aspect of my life. I have been struggling every time a move comes up, this usually involves flying back home from school abroad, or simply just packing up alone. I hate possessions, I hate going through them and feeling wasteful if I throw them away, but simply giving them away sometimes require too much effort. I would do it if it were to be more accessible. This time round, it should be easy to donate most things, but I would still have to discard a few things, unfortunately. Anyhow, moving on.</p>
<p>List of things I can declutter:</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Undergarments
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> one or two less used bras</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> old undies should go, buy new and higher quality ones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> kitchen utensils
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> I have no need for like&hellip; 3 sets, these can be donated, I got them for free so they&rsquo;re just a burden at this point.</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> the old scratchy pots and pans are going too</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> and so are some of the cutlery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> keyboard stuff
<ul>
<li>nts: <em>what a fucking stupid hobby, haha</em></li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> after the I68A GB, wormier leaves</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> I can&rsquo;t sell my pudding keycaps, might just have to use them as keycap molds for my future clay keycap hobby, or maybe just keep them around until someone needs them and they can be a nice gift&hellip;</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> I&rsquo;ll keep the old deskmat, stacking them is hip, right?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> jumpers
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> few old ones to charity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
