      <title>Realism and Anti-Realism</title>

      <description>1. Introduction Notes 1:2  Aim of this book:  To make clear what is really at stake in the contemporary realism debate Claim: no other book has succeeded in doing that Being more accessible than other books by containing less philosophical jargon    2:1  Definition of realism:  Realism about a particular domain is the conjunction (x and y) of the theses:  (i) the existence thesis: there are facts or entities distinctive of that domain (ii) the independence thesis: their existence and nature is in some important sense objective and mind-independent      2:2  Existence thesis (elaboration):  Caveat: involves quantification over entities and facts  Entities: referents of singular terms Facts: aspects of the world represented by whole declarative sentences Those who distinguished existence and independence thesis only quantified it over individuals Q: why is the involvement of both facts and entities awkward?</description>

      <title>Setting up TPM2 for a LUKS2-encrypted root partition</title>
      <link>https://hhn-pham.github.io/posts/tpm-luks/</link>

      <description>Motivation I was mildly content with entering my LUKS2 password every time I have to reboot my computer. Even though it is quite a complicated password, I got used to it; moreover, I rarely restarted anyway (at most once a day for important updates). However, I am facing a possibility of going without my keyboard for a bit (some days to some weeks). As I planned on using my laptop as a keyboard (not sure how this is going to play out, a post on that in the near future), I knew for sure any setup wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work if I am prompted for a decryption password.</description>

      <description>Difficulties using themes So far, my experience with Hu(go) has been alright. I found a nice theme called &amp;ldquo;cactus&amp;rdquo;, and while it worked when served locally for testing, it did not work when deployed (even just testing it locally by opening index.html), the css files were getting sourced and everything, but the website would not render any css. I found opened issues on Github saying that neither the css nor the html templates are valid.</description>

      <description>Neovim At first, I tried to configure Neovim&amp;rsquo;s plugins using Packer as opposed to using Vim-plug. I found out that it is easier to lazy-load plugins, so I tried to lazy-load as many as I can. Right now, I have 38 41 44 plugins, and so far only two of them are not lazy-loaded, as doing so messed things up no matter what I tried. By doing #!bash nvim --startuptime /path/to/file, it is reported that my Neovim takes 71 64 ms to load the screen, pretty good considering I have a lot of plugins.</description>

      <title>From Vimwiki to plain Markdown</title>

      <guid>https://hhn-pham.github.io/posts/from-vimwiki-to-plain-markdown/</guid>
      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m changing I have been using a combination of vimwiki and Mkdocs inside neovim for a while now, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really satisified with the outcome. Although Mkdocs with the material theme is extremely feature-packed (python markdown extensions are greatly useful), I feel like rejecting bloat and returning to simplicity is better for blogging/journalling/organising in general. Mkdocs was made with slick documentions in mind so the javascript was annoying me quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Definition  define an integer and reserves a location in memory for this specific variable  take an integer pointer:    int *pointer  this defines an integer pointer such that its content is the address of another place in memory  int var var = 10 pointer = &amp;amp;var  this defines an integer var, and &amp;amp;var is the address of a specific place in memory where the integer is stored  it also points the variable pointer to var   so that when checking out the value *pointer*, we get the content of var, which is 10  With arrays  pointers can also be appointed to arrays so that using (pointer + 1) points to certain array element matr[1].</description>

      <description>Migration Moving from yay to paru, I discovered a few useful commands that existed in yay that I never bothered checking out.
Cheatsheet Below is a snippet from my zshrc showing my paru aliases and their tldr:
alias u=&amp;#39;paru -Syu&amp;#39; #sync &amp;amp; upgrade alias usu=&amp;#39;paru -Syu --noconfirm&amp;#39; #sync &amp;amp; upgrade w/o confirmation alias pstats=&amp;#39;paru -Ps&amp;#39; #display stats alias pcmt=&amp;#39;paru -Gc&amp;#39; #display comments alias pnews=&amp;#39;paru -Pw&amp;#39; #display news alias pid=&amp;#39;paru -U&amp;#39; #install from local file(s) alias pir=&amp;#39;paru -S&amp;#39; #install from repositories alias pnd=&amp;#39;paru -Qi&amp;#39; #display info from database alias pnr=&amp;#39;paru -Si&amp;#39; #display info from repositories alias pfd=&amp;#39;paru -Qs&amp;#39; #search in database alias pfr=&amp;#39;paru -Ss&amp;#39; #search in repositories alias pls=&amp;#39;paru -Q&amp;#39; #list packages installed alias pls=&amp;#39;paru -Qea&amp;#39; #list packages explicitly installed alias orf=&amp;#39;paru -Qdt&amp;#39; #list orphaned packages alias pcc=&amp;#39;paru -Scd&amp;#39; #interactive cache removal FZF integration I also found that defining an installing and removing function which uses FZF to crawl through the local database is great.</description>

      <description>XDG_Base_Directory crisis I ls -a my home directory one morning and found that it is littered with .dir and .file from compilers and packages that do not comply with the XDG standards. I did realise that I did not export the variables in my zshrc, so I did that and emptied my home directory pretty well. However, there are quite a few that needed their separate variable, like PACKAGE_XYZ_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.config/xyz/, some even needed alias that points the config directory to the right place.</description>

      <description>Motivation I wanted a simple and creative way to manage my dotfiles, one which would allow more automation than my previous method. I stumbled upon many existing tools that can be utilised to manage dotfiles, such as GNU Stow and chezmoi. But they all seem to be too overkill for me, and their management method do not float my boat quite that well. Here&amp;rsquo;s what these tools might envision a ~/dotfiles or ~/.</description>

      <description>Utility I am now using hblock and it seems to be really great at managing /etc/hosts. To put simply, I have a template with my hostname and localhost, and then a sources.list file with StevenBlack master hostfile. Hblock essentially appends the StevenBlack&amp;rsquo;s hostfile to the template and then move it to /etc/hosts.</description>

I assigned ; to : a while ago, but I moved to &amp;lt;space&amp;gt;. While it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to change my muscle memory, it means since my leader key is ,, I can have the sequence comma+semicolon executing &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a qualm: there are simply too many chat services, it&amp;rsquo;s splitting my brain
 discord as primary communication with my boyfriend, some of my friends, and most of popular public servers  discord + e2ee @ browser for main discord &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android for main discord electron + betterdiscord integrations @ linux for alt, only for calling my boyfriend   telegram with my parents &amp;amp; lingering privacy-centric groups, or android modding groups  nekogram x @ android telegram k web @ browser   matrix (with libera bridge) for most public groups that are worthy enough to use the protocol, mainly privacy-focussed group and tech-related  fluffychat @ android mirage @ linux   whatsapp for absolute normies (uni groups, housemates, most irl boomers)  whatsapp &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android whatsapp web @ browser but cookies are not saved   messenger/facebook/instagram for some old friends, but I probably open those websites once a year at this point  barinsta &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android with chat function web versions @ browser but again, I simply avoid using it    Internet guide I followed this link below to integrate libera.</description>

      <description>Self-hosting  I sucesfully setup a docker container that is self-hosting bitwarden locally. I cannot expose the server so locally should be ideal still since I&amp;rsquo;m not going out as much or doing anything which requires instantaneous syncing. my passwords now contain a single point of failure, and that is my physical computer, if anything were to happen to the data on my nvme, then my passwords are screwed but hey, at least my passwords are not lingering somewhere on a centralised server that is very attractive to those with malicious intents I&amp;rsquo;m not important anyway, who would want to attack my local data?</description>

      <description>Page 27, paragraph 2, line 8-17  Since e^-20^ is a very small number and each term in the series can be rather large (of the order of 10^8^,it is clear that other terms as large as 10^8^, but negative, must cancel the figures in front of the decimal point and some behind as well. Since a computer can only hold a fixed number of significant figures, all those in front of the decimal point are not only useless, they are crowding out needed figures at the right end of the number.</description>

      <description>Question What on earth is a non-conservative force if all underlying forces of friction and other contact forces operate as conservative force on a microsopic level?
This one partially answers my question here
Hint: Mechanical energy is the keyword.
Another answer from stackexchange: Q: &amp;ldquo;How do many conservative forces come together to make a non-conservative one?&amp;rdquo; So my question how do several different Electromagnetic forces come together to make a new frictional force which is non-conservative in nature</description>

      <description>Note to self Maybe it will help reduce the anxiety surrounding this aspect of my life. I have been struggling every time a move comes up, this usually involves flying back home from school abroad, or simply just packing up alone. I hate possessions, I hate going through them and feeling wasteful if I throw them away, but simply giving them away sometimes require too much effort. I would do it if it were to be more accessible.</description>

I would say &amp;ldquo;other bits&amp;rdquo; first, obviously leaving the pc + monitor + peripherals until the day before but most clothes can be packed 3/4 days after a final laundry load (or I could just honestly wait to do laundry at the new place to save some dough)
 the boxes  monitor (I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put other things in) speakers + other bits rice-cooker + other bits pc leftover pantry items + other bits cookware + cutlery + other bits beddings   the suitcases  un: clothes (!</description>

      <description>dot product  perpendicular/orthogonal components are 0  $\hat{i} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{k} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{i}$ and so on and so forth    vector product  I generally find the right hand rule to be very straight forward  index $\times$ middle = thumb    </description>

      <title>Luks on LVM</title>

      <description>LUKS setup I wanted to protect my desktop PC with LUKS2, I decided to use LVM after reading not so good things about BTRFS. I settled on LUKS on LVM instead of LVM on LUKS because I wanted to have partition separation for easier control if I do end up with a corrupted root partition. While chain unlocking is not as secure as entering two passwords to decrypt two partitions, the guide I used worked and it is a very good guide which explains everything.</description>

      <description>The Cartesian body  motion of a body is a change of relation to the bodies that surround it. concept of inertia  a body&amp;rsquo;s motion will be preserved unless caused to deviate from its path so not a function of its spatial relations to other bodies but of its causal relation    The Newtonian body  a body&amp;rsquo;s motion is not a function of its spatial relations to other objects but rather of whether forces are impressed on it.</description>

      <description> unit: steradian (sr) analogous to plane angle, which is defined by arc length and radius, but unlike the plane angle, it is defined by the surface area of a sphere subtended by the lines and by the radius of that sphere (squared, for a correct dimensional analysis.  $\theta = \frac{l}{dr}$ $\Omega = \frac{a}{r^2}$ unlike the plane angle, it cannot be conceived of without reference to an arbitrary sphere.  this was a pretty intuitive and sympathetic explanation      </description>

      <description>Vectors Notations  the basis is the set of unit vectors from which all others are built perpendicular axes normally have basis vectors $\boldsymbol{\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}}$  helpful to remember: i = 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock, j = 4 o&amp;rsquo;clock, k = 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock (standard) this is right-handed axes (anti-clockwise)   $\boldsymbol{\hat{a}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{a}}{\left|a\right|}$  Components  $\theta$ taken from x-axis  $a_x = a\cos{\theta}$ $a_y = a\sin{\theta}$ $\tan{\theta} = \frac{a_y}{a_x}$ $\left|a\right| = \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2}$   3D components  pretty much compliant with 2D and 1D examples, but the concept of an angle might be harder to visualise, we rely on the unit vectors as it&amp;rsquo;s a much easier system.</description>
