Today, just 8 days from the start of my first semester exams, I decided to redo
my blog/personal site. I was using Hugo before. Today I moved to Jekyll,
because it integrates well with Github Pages. Also, I love how like half of my
posts so far are just about jumping to a different SSG.

I considered neocities, since it seems so nostalgic and gives off a Tumblr
vibe, albeit more mature. Don't expect anything mature here though. I like to
shitpost from time to time, or perhaps most of the time.

This is my first post here, and hopefully it'll motivate me to write more. I
have removed random uni notes from here, and the _zettelkasten_ system hasn't
really worked for me since I can type into a search engine (Searx ftw!) faster
than I can recall which zettle I wanted to open and what it was called.

There's not much more to say, I just have to create a new git repo, replace the
old one with this one, and finally commit and push when I'm done migrating.

It's 11:30pm, I'm currently typing in Neovim, hearing the nice clacks of
broken in retooled cherry mx blacks. Nothing can ever beat this level of /comfy/. Adios!
