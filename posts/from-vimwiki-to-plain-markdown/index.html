<p>I have been using a combination of vimwiki and Mkdocs inside <a href="/posts/vim/">neovim</a> for a while now, but I&rsquo;m not really satisified with the outcome. Although Mkdocs with the material theme is extremely feature-packed (python markdown extensions are greatly useful), I feel like rejecting bloat and returning to simplicity is better for blogging/journalling/organising in general. Mkdocs was made with slick documentions in mind so the javascript was annoying me quite a bit.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>I looked up SSG and found Hugo to be easy to use, I have yet to deploy a GitHub page with it and archive my Mkdocs repository, but once I do it, it will feel like a proper personal blog!</p>
<p>In terms of neovim, I will replace vimwiki with a good Markdown syntax plugin because the built-in one is hot garbage. This means I won&rsquo;t need vim-zettel as well, and instead of using any plugins, I will just manage my page with <code>hugo &lt;command&gt;</code> instead. But good syntax-highlighting and font-formatting is what I&rsquo;m looking for. Following links can be done with <code>gf</code> and fuzzy search or <code>live_grep</code> for it with telescope.nvim.</p>
<p>Anyway, this would be my first post created with Hugo&rsquo;s built-in commands.</p>
<h3 id="update-2508">Update 25/08</h3>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown">this</a> to be the best vim Markdown plugin. I can edit some of its highlight groups to add <code>gui=strikethrough</code> for strikethrough support. While following links don&rsquo;t quite work because I have to declare cross-referenced links like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">&#34;[]({{_<span style="color:#eceff4">&lt;</span> <span style="color:#81a1c1">rel</span><span style="color:#bf616a">/</span><span style="color:#8fbcbb">relref</span> <span style="color:#eceff4">&gt;</span>_}})&#34;
</code></pre></div><p>Which the plugin cannot understand, however, if I hover my mouse over text.md, and use <code>gf</code>, I follow the link like magic. Mind that in the snippet above, where there is an underscore, it is to escape characters to not break the site rendering.</p>
