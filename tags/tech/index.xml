      <description>Difficulties using themes So far, my experience with Hu(go) has been alright. I found a nice theme called &amp;ldquo;cactus&amp;rdquo;, and while it worked when served locally for testing, it did not work when deployed (even just testing it locally by opening index.html), the css files were getting sourced and everything, but the website would not render any css. I found opened issues on Github saying that neither the css nor the html templates are valid.</description>

      <title>From Vimwiki to plain Markdown</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m changing I have been using a combination of vimwiki and Mkdocs inside neovim for a while now, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really satisified with the outcome. Although Mkdocs with the material theme is extremely feature-packed (python markdown extensions are really good), I feel like rejecting bloat and returning to simplicity is better for blogging/journalling/organising in general. Mkdocs was made with slick documentions in mind so the javascript was annoying me quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Migration Moving from yay to paru, I discovered a few useful commands that existed in yay that I never bothered checking out.
Cheatsheet Below is a snippet from my zshrc showing my paru aliases and their tldr:
alias pu=&amp;#39;paru -Syu&amp;#39; #sync &amp;amp; upgrade alias pusu=&amp;#39;paru -Syu --noconfirm&amp;#39; #sync &amp;amp; upgrade w/o confirmation alias pfetch=&amp;#39;paru -Ps&amp;#39; #display stats alias pcom=&amp;#39;paru -Gc&amp;#39; #display comments alias pnews=&amp;#39;paru -Pw&amp;#39; #display news alias pid=&amp;#39;paru -U&amp;#39; #install from local file(s) alias pir=&amp;#39;paru -S&amp;#39; #install from repositories alias pnd=&amp;#39;paru -Qi&amp;#39; #display info from database alias pnr=&amp;#39;paru -Si&amp;#39; #display info from repositories alias pfd=&amp;#39;paru -Qs&amp;#39; #search in database alias pfr=&amp;#39;paru -Ss&amp;#39; #search in repositories alias pls=&amp;#39;paru -Q&amp;#39; #list packages installed alias plsa=&amp;#39;paru -Qea&amp;#39; #list packages explicitly installed alias porf=&amp;#39;paru -Qdt&amp;#39; #list orphaned packages alias pcc=&amp;#39;paru -Scd&amp;#39; #interactive cache removal FZF integration I also found that defining an installing and removing function which uses FZF to crawl through the local database is great.</description>

      <description>Motivation I wanted a simple and creative way to manage my dotfiles, one which would allow more automation than my previous method. I stumbled upon many existing tools that can be utilised to manage dotfiles, such as GNU Stow and chezmoi. But they all seem to be too overkill for me, and their management method do not float my boat quite that well. Here&amp;rsquo;s what these tools might envision a ~/dotfiles or ~/.</description>

      <description>Utility I am now using hblock and it seems to be really great at managing /etc/hosts. To put simply, I have a template with my hostname and localhost, and then a sources.list file with StevenBlack master hostfile. Hblock essentially appends the StevenBlack&amp;rsquo;s hostfile to the template and then move it to /etc/hosts.</description>

      <description>Experience I wanted to make a custom cheatsheet with all my custom bindings, (update 24/08: after constantly forcing myself to look up ways to do things without just going jjj or kkkk or whatever repetitive motions you would normally do, I&amp;rsquo;m a much better vim user now)
I assigned ; to : a while ago, but I moved to &amp;lt;space&amp;gt;. While it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to change my muscle memory, it means since my leader key is ,, I can have the sequence comma+semicolon executing &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a qualm: there are simply too many chat services, it&amp;rsquo;s splitting my brain
 discord as primary communication with my boyfriend, some of my friends, and most of popular public servers  discord + e2ee @ browser for main discord &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android for main discord electron + betterdiscord integrations @ linux for alt, only for calling my boyfriend   telegram with my parents &amp;amp; lingering privacy-centric groups, or android modding groups  nekogram x @ android telegram k web @ browser   matrix (with libera bridge) for most public groups that are worthy enough to use the protocol, mainly privacy-focussed group and tech-related  fluffychat @ android mirage @ linux   whatsapp for absolute normies (uni groups, housemates, most irl boomers)  whatsapp &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android whatsapp web @ browser but cookies are not saved   messenger/facebook/instagram for some old friends, but I probably open those websites once a year at this point  barinsta &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android with chat function web versions @ browser but again, I simply avoid using it    Internet guide I followed this link below to integrate libera.</description>

      <description>Local-hosting So I&amp;rsquo;m hosting a Tiny Tiny RSS locally (LAN-only) and it works great, the web-ui is so damn slick with awesome-ttrss
On the phone I am using the default app on f-droid and although there is no inline reading mode, it still works pretty well, all articles will have to be saved offline once I leave my house
To get it running on my box: cd $HOME/docker/rss docker-compose up -d </description>

      <description>Self-hosting  I sucesfully setup a docker container that is self-hosting bitwarden locally. I cannot expose the server so locally should be ideal still since I&amp;rsquo;m not going out as much or doing anything which requires instantaneous syncing. my passwords now contain a single point of failure, and that is my physical computer, if anything were to happen to the data on my nvme, then my passwords are screwed but hey, at least my passwords are not lingering somewhere on a centralised server that is very attractive to those with malicious intents I&amp;rsquo;m not important anyway, who would want to attack my local data?</description>

      <description>LUKS setup I wanted to protect my desktop PC with LUKS2, I decided to use LVM after reading not so good things about BTRFS. I settled on LUKS on LVM instead of LVM on LUKS because I wanted to have partition separation for easier control if I do end up with a corrupted root partition. While chain unlocking is not as secure as entering two passwords to decrypt two partitions, the guide I used worked and it is a very good guide which explains everything.</description>
