<h4 id="12">1:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Aim of this book:
<ul>
<li>To make clear what is really at stake in the contemporary realism debate</li>
<li>Claim: no other book has succeeded in doing that</li>
<li>Being more accessible than other books by containing less philosophical jargon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="21">2:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Definition of realism:
<ul>
<li>Realism about a particular domain is the <em>conjunction</em> (x and y) of the theses:
<ul>
<li><strong>(i) the existence thesis</strong>: <em>there are facts or entities distinctive of that domain</em></li>
<li><strong>(ii) the independence thesis</strong>: <em>their existence and nature is in some important sense objective and mind-independent</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="22">2:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Existence thesis (elaboration):
<ul>
<li><em>Caveat</em>: involves quantification over entities <em>and</em> facts
<ul>
<li>Entities: referents of singular terms</li>
<li>Facts: aspects of the world represented by whole declarative sentences</li>
<li>Those who distinguished existence and independence thesis only quantified it over individuals</li>
<li><strong>Q: why is the involvement of both facts and entities awkward?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Q: what does quantifying it over individuals mean?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Except: it is possible to be a realist about a domain without thinking there are any special entities distinctive of that domain
<ul>
<li>Example: What goes up must come down as a <strong>fact</strong>, but gravitational fields is <strong>not</strong> a realist entity</li>
<li>They are considered scientific realists, not realists about scientific entities
<ul>
<li>Other domains:

</ul>
<h4 id="31">3:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>For a domain to be <strong>objective</strong> and <strong>mind-independent</strong>, it must not be any of the following:
<ul>
<li>sense-data of phenomenalism (Russell&rsquo;s table)</li>
<li>ideas of idealism (Berkeleyan subjective idealism: ideas exist only in mind, so is wholly mind-independent)</li>
<li>monads of Leibniz</li>
<li>phenomenal world of Kant (versus the noumenal)</li>
<li>verifiable world of the logical positivist (verificationism: meaning derived from verifiability)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Realist facts must be discovered, not constructed
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: is there a language barrier somewhere? Can the world exist without any ideas/thoughts, and facts in their domains are present, but in a crude form that is then constructed into coherent language?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Entities must be detected, not constituted mentally</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Contains quotes of what other philosopher defines realism to be</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="42">4:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>A diagram showing realism and anti-realism with respect to mind-independent and existence (or non-existence)</li>
<li>Third quadrant is empty, this is because the two theses are not independent of one another.
<ul>
<li><em>In order for an individual or fact to be dependent on our minds, it must exist; mind-dependence therefore guarantees existence</em></li>
<li>mind-dependence $\rightarrow$ existence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="53">5:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some philosophers espouse that realism requires the following supplement:
<ul>
<li><strong>The confidence thesis:</strong> <em>Although it may in some circumstances be difficult, we are always capable of coming to know about the existence and nature of the domain we are realists about. That domain is epistemically accessible to us</em>
<ul>
<li>This position directly opposes the sceptic, it is an optimistic alternative to scepticism</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="61">6:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smart, Papineau, Pettit, Thomasson, and others added:
<ul>
<li><strong>The insecurity thesis</strong>: It is possible to be in ignorance of error about the domain we are realists about. To avoid such mistakes, one must make appropriate contact with the domain in question, and there is no guarantee that anyone will succeed in doing that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="62">6:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>These two supplementary positions are not contradictory, the insecurity thesis does aid scepticism but cannot pave way to scepticism without completely denying the confidence thesis.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="63">6:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is controversial to introduce an <strong>epistemic component</strong> to realism
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: What does this mean? Is an epistemic component involving our own knowledge being able to realise things? A: The epistemic account involves the supplementary theses</strong></li>
<li>If we are Cartesians about ourselves (knowing our own existence incorrigibly and infallibly), according to the insecurity thesis, we would still undermine this.</li>
<li>Objects outside our light cone cannot be observed, but then according to the confidence thesis, this would undermine their reality.</li>
<li>Thus, canonical realism in this book does not include the supplementary theses (they are called supplementary for this exact reason).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="71">7:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some also scrap existence and independence thesis for a semantic thesis
<ul>
<li>This involves linguistic philosophy</li>
<li>It provides an emphasis on truth and meaning <strong>Q: instead of mind and metaphysics?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="72">7:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dummett attempted such re-characterisation
<ul>
<li>Distinctive statements are either true or false, independent of our means for knowing it.</li>
<li>Distinguishes realism and anti-realism with respect to truth
<ul>
<li>Realism: a proposition is true iff it corresponds to the facts. <strong>Correspondence theory of truth</strong></li>
<li>Anti-realism: a theory that equates truth with warranted assertability, practical utility, or other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This semantic take is controversial
<ul>
<li>Kuhn, Putnam, Dummett and Wright gave a semantic spin</li>
<li>Lewis, Devitt and Horwich deny any connection between the problem of realism and the problems of truth and meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Realism is a metaphysical position, while true and meaning is to do with epistemic or semantic?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This section introduces realism and touches on anti-realism by denoting what realism is not. It lays out the 2 main theses of realism; the existence and independence theses. Besides the two main theses, other philosophers also like the idea of an <em>epistemic</em> component of realism. However, this book will avoid including the two epistemic theses as part of the realist canonical because it leads to a lot of controversy.</p>

<h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3>
<h4 id="111">11:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Few are radical (global) realists or radical anti-realists.</li>
<li>The independent reality of some entities is a controversial matter.</li>
<li>It is more common for most of us to be local realists about some entities and local anti-realists about others.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="112">11:2</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimal realist</strong>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate that Fs exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Robust realist</strong>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate that Fs exists, and such entities exist independently of us.</li>
<li><strong>T: realism in this chapter refers to minimal realism</strong></li>
<li><strong>T: anti-realism refers to anti-minimal realism</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="121-__21-motivating-realism__">12:1 <strong>2.1 Motivating realism</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Presumptions that anti-realism is inferior to realism are unclaimed and dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>C: I agree with this; reading more about subjective idealism introduced an entire different way of thinking about reality. I like how it claims to be the common sense view</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="122">12:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Realist existential arguments are often <em>abductive</em> arguments, the &ldquo;inference to the best explanation (IBE — ampliative not explicative)&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>IBE includes <em>theoretical virtues</em>
<ul>
<li>simplicity</li>
<li>strength</li>
<li>elegance</li>
<li>ease of use</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="123">12:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IBE provides the <em>belief</em> in a particular theory, denoted as T</li>
<li><strong>Doctrine of Ontological commitments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Only persons can make OC, we can determine the OC of an individual by ascertaining the theories that they accept.</li>
<li>Then translate the theories the into first-order logic</li>
<li>Then isolate sentences that start with an existential quantifier.</li>
<li>These sentences are the OC of the individual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Quinean (a naturalist vs non-scientism) argument for minimal realism (an IBE)</strong>
<ul>
<li>(P1) We should believe that Fs exist if our accepted theories are ontologically committed to Fs.</li>
<li>(P2) The theories we accept are ontologically committed to Fs.</li>
<li>(C) Therefore, we should believe that Fs exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Q: Does that mean only OCs of an individual exist? Then does this mean realism only operate on an individual basis, how could criteria for existence be solely arbitrary theories (accepted by the individual)?</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="131">13:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quine suggested
<ul>
<li>(i) Embrace physicalism if we can fully explain consciousness, apparent miracles, mystical experiences, etc. as physical phenomena.</li>
<li>(ii) Paraphrase statements to avoid <em>unsavoury ontological commitments</em> (allow for more freedom of statements).
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Nobody is in my room&rdquo; (inferring at least one nobody exists is misleading)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) Rational: accepting a theory should also accept the entailments of the theory, including <em>existential entailments</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To determine what our <strong>ontological commitments are</strong> (Russell&rsquo;s line of arguments leading up to Phenomenalism):</li>
<li>1: Perceptions
<ul>
<li>Problem: Hallucinations/illusions/imperceivable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2: Language
<ul>
<li>Semantics and epistemology, how to work out truth values</li>
<li>Foundationalism: using a set of basic beliefs, axioms and build upon them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3: Language + Theories
<ul>
<li>Context-based knowledge</li>
<li>Linguistic &ldquo;coherentism&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="141">14:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meinong&rsquo;s &ldquo;particular&rdquo; quantifier</li>
<li>Every thing that exists has being in the particular sense
<ul>
<li>Some things have being but do not exist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="142">14:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, one could reject classical inferences that lead to uncomfortable OCs
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Puff is a magic dragon&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Do not conclude that there are any dragons</li>
<li>To draw the conclusion that there is at least one dragon requires an implicit premise: Puff exists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free logic
<ul>
<li>Existential quantifier $\exists_x$
<ul>
<li>Is not to be understood as &ldquo;There is an object such that&hellip;&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;There is a true substitution instance of&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This strategy denies existential generalisations carry with them any serious ontological commitment</li>
<li>However, philosophical orthodoxy disapproves of free logic. The chapter ends the discussion about this here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="151">15:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Realism success measured by how compelling it is to anti-realists.
<ul>
<li>Would have to justify (P2) from Quine&rsquo;s minimal realism argument.</li>
<li>Show that OCs are forced under (i) and (ii)
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: In the text, it mentions &lsquo;such&rsquo; commitments, what commitments?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="152-__motivating-anti-realism__">15:2 <strong>Motivating anti-realism</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The view that Fs do not exist
<ul>
<li>Task: undermine one of the premises of the realist&rsquo;s argument
<ul>
<li>Either: show our accepted theories are not ontologically committed to Fs, they are dispensable entities</li>
<li>Or: show that even if our accepted theories are ontologically committed to Fs, there is no reason to believe that Fs exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, merely demonstrating a fallacy in the realist&rsquo;s conclusion does not mean the conclusion is false.
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: But isn&rsquo;t demonstrating fallacy weaken the credibility of the conclusion?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="153">15:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Arguments against realism
<ul>
<li>The two horns of realism
<ul>
<li>(R1) If Fs exist, they must be <em>sui generis</em> properties.</li>
<li>(R2) If Fs exist, they must be reducible to some other kind of property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the realist chooses (R1), they violate the <em>principle of parsimony</em>. <a href="#21:1">See definition</a></li>
<li>If the realist chooses (R2), they will face an <em>&lsquo;attitude problem&rsquo;</em> <a href="#23:2">See definition</a></li>
<li><strong>Q: The terminology can be confusing, but is this synonymous to the problem of intentionality, i.e. the Clark Kent and Superman example (specific to Philosophy of Mind)?</strong></li>
<li>This isn&rsquo;t applicable as an argument in support of global anti-realism.
<ul>
<li>Only a special certain domain of Fs purported in the objection gives rise to the dilemma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="161-__221-ockhams-razor__">16:1 <strong>2.2.1 Ockham&rsquo;s Razor</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of disagreement over what exactly the principle of parsimony is and what it counsels us to do (despite being non-controversial)</li>
<li>This is not life guidance, it is guidance for our choices between competing theories.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="162">16:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Thus it favours anti-realism over realism.
<ul>
<li>Realism: Fs exist because our accepted theories are ontologically committed to Fs.</li>
<li>Anti-realism: There is an alternative theory that is not committed to Fs but as serviceable
<ul>
<li>committed to nothing not already precolor-keephue: trueostulated by the accepted theory.</li>
<li>Ockham&rsquo;s razor: we should believe that there are no Fs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="171">17:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>For Ockham&rsquo;s razor to be a valid tool in the anti-realist&rsquo;s argument, it must not be ambiguous.</li>
<li>There is one version that challenges realism. This part discusses what it is.</li>
<li><strong>Two versions of parsimony</strong>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative
<ul>
<li>Keeps down the number of different kinds of entity</li>
<li>Controversial: reduction can remove intentional properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quantitative
<ul>
<li>Keeps down the number of instances of the kinds it posits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="172">17:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Examples of each type of parsimony</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="173">17:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>The anti-realist uses the qualitative kind</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="181">18:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Aim of metaphysics: distinguishes reality into its basic categories and kinds.</li>
<li>It is uncommon to perform metaphysics on particulars</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="182">18:2</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sober:</strong> highlights an ambiguity in the razor:
<ul>
<li><em>Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity</em>
<ul>
<li>Often interpreted as: if we have no reason for believing something exists, we thereby have reason for believing that it does not exist. (named the <strong>replacement rule</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there is a <strong>weaker</strong> alternative interpretation of the razor:
<ul>
<li>If there is no necessity to postulate an entity, we should <em>suspend judgement about its existence</em> (named the <strong>deletion rule</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="183">18:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Support for deletion rule is easier than support for the replacement rule
<ul>
<li>The probability of any conjunction is never higher than the probability of either of the conjuncts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only the replacement rule supports an anti-realist position, since the deletion rule simply suspends judgement and does not posit anything interesting.</li>
<li>19:1</li>
<li>The razor is so important that the anti-realist also needs to provide meta-justification for accepting it.
<ul>
<li><strong>C: It seems like a lot of justification burden is placed on the anti-realist. So far, realism puts forward a few statements with few justifications beyond IBE on why their argument is sound. But anti-realism has to justify carefully all its methodology. Seems imbalanced.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The realist is not required to accept the razor&rsquo;s replacement version.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="192">19:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the anti-realist can appeal to common sense and intuition
<ul>
<li><strong>C: the realist did that too but, there was no justification burden</strong></li>
<li>But better independent justification for the razor is to be found elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>19:3</li>
<li><strong>Sober:</strong> The razor must be embraced if inductive generalisations are sound.</li>
<li>Philosophers accept inductive generalisations</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="201">20:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Constraints must be met for induction to have credence.
<ul>
<li>In this context: for an inductive generalisation to be good, <em>the premise must represent all available relevant experience</em> (named the <strong>total relevant evidence constraint</strong>, <strong>TRE</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="202">20:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Transforms the emerald inference to its logical equivalent that satisfies TRE.</li>
<li>Thus, if inductive generalisations are good inferences, then lack of evidence in support of the existence of some kind counts as evidence for its non-existence.</li>
<li><em>Induction presupposes the razor</em></li>
<li><strong>C: This is a nice paragraph that describes the relationship between inductive inference and the razor. I like this particular argument that shows if a realist accepts usage of inductive inferences that are good (TRE), then they must accept the parsimony.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="211">21:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Idealised version of the anti-realist&rsquo;s argument:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ontological Parsimony</strong>
<ul>
<li>(P1) Fs are superfluous to our explanatory needs</li>
<li>(P2) Ockham&rsquo;s Razor: don&rsquo;t multiply entities unnecessarily. If Fs are superfluous to our explanatory needs, then Fs don&rsquo;t exist</li>
<li>(C) Fs don&rsquo;t exist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>There is an objection against (P2).
<ul>
<li>Because (P2) sometimes mislead us to reject a theory out of two where the two are merely <em>notational variants</em> of one another.
<ul>
<li>Example of Ed and Stu&rsquo;s shopping lists.
<ul>
<li>Stu has same items, but with different names due to language variance.
<ul>
<li>(P2) would imply that Ed&rsquo;s reality is more likely to be true than Stu&rsquo;s because it is simpler and doesn&rsquo;t contain any <em>superfluous</em> entries.
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitively, this seems wrong</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed only contains one meaning of each word, so Ed has saved time; but his view of the world is not really more economical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="221">22:1</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Reduction</em> and <em>elimination</em> both want theoretical economy of kinds.
<ul>
<li>Difference
<ul>
<li><strong>Reductionist</strong> keeps ontology of Fs intact, maintains it exists, but identifies Fs with something else (reductionism)</li>
<li><strong>Eliminativist</strong> eliminates Fs from their ontology altogether.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parsimony (P2) seems to favour Eliminativsm over Reductionism.</li>
<li><strong>Q: I don&rsquo;t get why the author then goes on to say that both R and E are not justified, and that R is basically the same as E?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="222">22:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>This does not pose any serious challenge to (P2)
<ul>
<li>A small mitigation can be drawn:
<ul>
<li>If Fs are superfluous and irreducibly distinct, then Fs don&rsquo;t exist.
<ul>
<li>This would keep all the notational variants from the Ed and Stu examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or no mitigation at all:
<ul>
<li>The reduced property cannot be superfluous unless the reductive base is also superfluous. We should not eliminate one but not the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>22:3</li>
<li>However, the parsimony argument only works against non-reductive realism.
<ul>
<li>The anti-realist does not have any force against it if Fs are not <em>sui generis</em> but reducible properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="224">22:4</h4>
<ul>
<li>The anti-realist can amend the definition of &ldquo;realism&rdquo; to match their own argument.
<ul>
<li>Only conserve realism as the first quarter of the axis, so that they are not reductionists, but hold that:
<ul>
<li><em>entities posited are distinctive in the sense that they are not a priori identifiable with, or otherwise, replaceable by, entities independently posited.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="231">23:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amendment to the canonical definition of realism is unnecessary.
<ul>
<li>They state that &ldquo;reductive realism&rdquo; is an <em>oxymoron</em>.
<ul>
<li>Any reduction covertly involves a step of elimination (mind-dependently), hence cannot fall on the right side. So any form of reductionism cannot count as a form of realism.</li>
<li><strong>Q: nominalist construal of mathematics?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes, treating reductionists as realists mean that we have to take their statements literally, even though the disguised eliminations make our commitment deceptive. The solution to this is implausible. This is problematic, because in some context, reduced talk should not be taken at face value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="232">23:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Another strategy is to attack reductions only of certain kinds, producing &lsquo;Attitude problems&rsquo;
<ul>
<li>(P1) Subjects have a certain attitude towards the A-facts</li>
<li>(P2) Subjects do not have that same attitude towards the B-facts</li>
<li>(C) Therefore, the A-facts are not reducible to the B-facts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="241">24:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Attitude argument is not deductively valid.
<ul>
<li>Attitude contexts are opaque contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example about Gerald Ford and Leslie King</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="242">24:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Attitude argument is never decisive against the reductionist, but can be powerful inductive considerations against reductionism.</li>
<li>All attitude problems contain an implicit premise:
<ul>
<li><em>if the A-facts were reducible to the B-facts, subjects would know as much</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="252">25:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Jackson against physicalism.
<ul>
<li><strong>Physicalism: all facts, including mental facts, can be reduced to physical facts</strong></li>
<li>Any physicalist theory will not be able to account for facts about qualia</li>
<li>Thus, mental states are not reducible to physical states</li>
</ul>

<li>Jackson: <strong>&ldquo;Knowledge Argument&rdquo;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mary the Scientist thought experiment.</li>
<li>Presented as follows:
<ul>
<li>(P1) Before her release, Mary knows everything physical there is to know about colour experience.</li>
<li>(P2) Before her release, Mary does not know everything there is to know about colour experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, facts about colour experience cannot be reduced to the physical facts (thus physicalism is false)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="262">26:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Why Jackson&rsquo;s argument is successful:
<ul>
<li>First two premises point to an asymmetry of a subject&rsquo;s attitude in two related domains</li>
<li>Jackson gave us a special reason (colours) for thinking that mental facts cannot be reduced to physical facts Jackson left all other domains untouched.</li>
<li>Jackson pointed out what it is that is asymmetrical (physical information vs psychological information)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>C: There is more on how Jackson later retracted knowledge and zombie argument.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="263">26:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Jackson did not provide a direct support for anti-realism
<ul>
<li>Example: He is a realist about the mental and qualia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But the anti-realist can use it
<ul>
<li>Qualia is irreducible</li>
<li>QUalia is sui generis, so plays no explanatory role</li>
<li>Qualia is thus dispensable</li>
<li>Razor: Eliminate the existence of qualia.
<ul>
<li>Qualia is complicated however: Epiphenomenalism vs Physicalism vs Substance dualism vs Overdetermination. They are not superfluous but according to Jackson, they have no causal consequences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="271">27:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anti-realists have to address another issue:
<ul>
<li>How can a subject have an attitude towards a set of facts, if there are no such facts at all?
<ul>
<li><strong>C: Some sort of strategy here: Can thoughts and mental statements about two sets of facts that receive differing attitudes have their counterfactual existence be different as well?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>C: For an anti-realist, it might be the case that nothing determines counterfactual existence. If I have different attitudes about A and B in my mind, had A and B have existed, then they would also differ as well.</strong></li>

<li>Existence is often claimed to be univocal regardless of the domain it is used in.

<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>This chapter went in-depth about why one would want to be a realist, either globally or locally, about a certain domain, likewise, why one would want to be an anti-realist. It motivates realism through IBE and Quine&rsquo;s argument for minimal realism, which concerns the concept of ontological commitments. But, it motivates anti-realism by several responses through the horns of Parsimony (sui generis) or Attitude (reductive realism). It also details several anti-realist arguments, which belong to the top-left quadrant of the axis, namely the mind-independent but non-existent. Finally, it places anti-realist arguments into either the hermeneutic or revolutionary approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Preliminary remarks
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Their approach is to identify two different kinds of mind-dependence that lead to a restricted anti-realism. This undermines robust realism because they deny entities are mind-dependent in either of these two ways</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>In both cases, there are a lot of disagreements about how to articulate mind-dependence. Their accounts are not to rule out by fiat a version of realism or anti-realism about any domain.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>It is controversial to suggest that anything mind-dependent would not be a bona fide citizen of the robustly real world. If this claims succeed, they would successfully argue against the quietist.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>POSITION: bottom right</strong></li>
<li>One way an entity is to depend on us is by being <em>socially constructed</em>
<ul>
<li>The list of things that are said to be socially constructed is so large that it is hard to unify them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hacking&rsquo;s description of SC:
<ul>
<li>Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:</li>
</ul>
<ol start="0">
<li>In the present state of affairs, X is taken for granted; X appears to be inevitable</li>
<li>X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable.</li>
<li>X is quite bad as it is.</li>
<li>We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For example: those who claim that gender, race or sexual orientation are socially constructed tend to claim that there is prejudice in those domains.
<ul>
<li>If we choose to reject them such prejudices will disappear or diminish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although some things can be socially constructed without clause 0,2 or 3.
<ul>
<li>Thus, clause 1 seems like a necessary condition for something to be socially constructed.
<ul>
<li>This chapter expands on clause 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="381">38:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>What are socially constructed entities determined by, if not by the &ldquo;nature of things&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>They are determined by or depend on the <em>intentions</em> of human beings.</li>
<li>Intentions are compounded mental states. States composed of, <em>inter alia</em>, beliefs and desires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="382">38:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dependence == causally dependence. Definition:
<ul>
<li><em>Causal dependence:</em> A domain of Fs causally depends on us iff we play an essential causal role in bringing the Fs into existence; that is, the Fs would not have come into existence in the first place had human beings, and our concomitant actions, intentions and mental states not existed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="383">38:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>But intuition tells us that causally constructed entities are as real as anything else.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="391">39:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Kukla: compatibility of realism and social constructivism exists, but there is also another variety that is incompatible.
<ul>
<li>Constructed objects need humans to be constructed</li>
<li>But they do not need humans for their continued existence.</li>
<li>There are entities that would cease to exist without the continued presence of human agents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="392">39:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>From this special type of constructed entities, one has the following notion:
<ul>
<li><strong>Metaphysical dependence: A domain of Fs metaphysically depends on us iff the continued existence of our minds is required for the continued existence of the Fs.</strong></li>
<li>Examples: money, nations, kings, presidents, and prime ministers.</li>
<li>They are called <strong>psychological constructions (PC)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="401">40:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Are PCs mind-dependent, i.e, not part of the non-objective realm?
<ul>
<li>Not yet
<ul>
<li>Minds are trivially mind-dependent, but they are still robustly real.</li>
<li>Human minds are not constructed at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="402">40:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Need more explication to understand what it takes to be psychologically constructed (beyond dependence for continued existence).
<ul>
<li>By looking at differences between PCs and mental states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="403">40:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trivially true that mental facts supervene on mental facts</li>
<li>But not true that psychologically constructions supervene on mental facts.
<ul>
<li><strong>C: This chapter should explain the conditions for supervenience</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience">Here</a> is the link for further reading.</li>
<li>X is said to supervene on Y iff changes in Y is necessary for changes in X.</li>
<li>X is said to supervene on Y iff all things Y-indiscernible is also X-indiscernible.</li>
<li>X is said to supervene on Y iff anything that has an X-property has some Y-property such that anything that has an X-property also has that Y-property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One could hold fixed all the facts about minds, without holding fixed the facts about money, gender, so on and so forth.
<ul>
<li>PCs can have properties none of us have ever been aware of.
<ul>
<li>If we know everything there is to know about minds, we still wouldn&rsquo;t know all the facts about things that are PCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="404">40:4</h4>
<ul>
<li>SC entities are at least partially composed of natural, non-constructed entities.
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s why supervenience fails.
<ul>
<li>Countries are composed of land-masses, borders drawn along rivers and mountains</li>
<li>Money is composed of coloured paper</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These facts do not supervene on mental states, but all serve some social function because as a community, we have decided on it.
<ul>
<li><strong>C: This reminds me vaguely of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s beetle-in-a-box. It&rsquo;s a concept that may live differently in different minds but in a shared language game, they act as social adhesive.</strong></li>
<li>Due to this, they are arbitrary, we could have made different choices in this regard, and thus the exact formulation of the PC would not have come into existence.</li>
<li>If we change our minds, the PC would also go out of existence.</li>

<ul>
<li>However, we cannot wish our minds out of existence. Thus, it remains independently real. Unlike PCs, which we can wish out of existence (last paragraph).

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="413">41:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>For an entity to be a PC, it needs to both metaphysically depend on us and require that we have appropriate intention; that they continue to exist.

<ul>
<li>Johnston, Wright, Pettit: introduce <em>response-dependent concept</em></li>
<li><strong>Response-dependent concepts: concepts whose extensions depend in a very special way on us and our mental responses.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>A concept F is response-dependent iff there is a bi-conditional of the form &ldquo;x is F iff x is disposed to produce response R in subject S in conditions C&rdquo; that is knowable a priori</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A lot of properties belong to the RDC. Not all of them are secondary qualities.</li>

<h4 id="424-431">42:4 43:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Utmost important that the truth of the bi-conditional is knowable <em>a priori</em>, since any concept may coincidentally provoke a response in subjects like us.
<ul>
<li>Example: mistaking mass to be an RDC, but not justifying that there is an a priori connection between the concept and the judgement.</li>
<li>Example: glass is fragile if they and only if they are disposed to shatter when dropped
<ul>
<li>Fragility is not an RDC; the subject has to be humans or persons, and they must produce a response that is a mental process, an <em>affective, conative or cognitive</em> state. (Conation = volition or desire)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An interesting RDP: a judgement-dependent concept; concept whose extensions are determined by our judgements or beliefs employing that concept.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="432-441">43:2 44:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Final point for RDC
<ul>
<li>the conditions specified identify restrictions on the subjects and environment required for it to be knowable <em>a priori</em>.
<ul>
<li>It is not <em>a priori</em> that something is red iff it causes red sensations in humans like us.
<ul>
<li>Unconscious or blind people will not have this kind of experience, nor will normal-sighted people when it is covered in a blanket or in a dark room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C-conditions state explicitly the required subject and environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wright: for every concept there is a basic equation associated with it that is knowable a priori.
<ul>
<li>Example: for a concept F, the following bi-conditionals are a priori knowable:
<ul>
<li>x is F iff
<ul>
<li>an omniscient God would judge that x is F</li>
<li>subjects who are good at identifying Fs would believe that x is F in favourable environments.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>

<h4 id="442">44:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>RDCs pick out dispositional properties, and dispositional properties are intrinsic.
<ul>
<li>Thus, they do not metaphysically nor causally depend on us.</li>
<li>The potential of some entity to have the property F-ness does not depend on our physical and mental existence
<ul>
<li>Example: addictiveness of tobacco.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="443">44:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>This distinction that RDCs are intrinsic undermines anti-realism, because intrinsic properties seem inappropriate in an anti-realist&rsquo;s bag of tools.</li>
<li>This fact is relieved in support of anti-realism through three compromises (Pettit 1991):
<ul>
<li>(i) RDCs implicate the subject in a way that RICs do not. There are non-empty concepts essentially connected to our mental states. It would be uncomfortable to suggest that objective reality behave in such way to be so connected to our mental world. Thus, this is a good reason to think that RDCs are in conflict with realism.</li>
<li>(ii) Extensions of RDCs do not meet the constraint of <em>&lsquo;ontic neutrality&rsquo;</em>. There is no reason to think that other species beside humans will have the same responses. This furthers support for anti-realism.</li>
<li>(iii) (The insecurity thesis)[#61] is in conflict with RDCs. RDCs in fact cannot lead subjects astray. This is certainly true for many examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="444">44:4</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is a reason against RDCs being anti-realist. Wright considered this worry:
<ul>
<li>Consider the case of intention: It is <em>a priori</em> that <em>x</em> intends to $\psi$ iff x is disposed to believe that she intends to $\psi$ in situations where she is not self-deceived. Thus, intention is RDCs, then our mental states are in part not mind-dependent.
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Is this in part reductio ad absurdum?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="461">46:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wright suggests perhaps mental concepts are not RDCs
<ul>
<li><em>In situations where she is not self-deceived</em> is a C-condition that is non-trivial and hence makes it a priori, however, what does this C-condition mean?
<ul>
<li>It must presume she is not self-deceived when she knows she is not self-deceived.</li>
<li>This is tautological and is thus trivial.</li>
<li>This condition is trivial and thus intentions are not a form of RDC, keep our mental states separate from RDCs.</li>

<ul>
<li>Any attempt to undermine realism using mind-dependence appears preposterous or empty

<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<p>This chapter talks about the dependence axis. It mentions a few theories in the top left quadrant, such as error theory, fictionalism, instrumentalism, non-factualism, and a few theories in the bottom right quadrant, such as social constructivism and response-dependent theory. It discusses the possibility of these theories and how they might or might not be successful at defending anti-realism or critiquing realism. They want to challenge the quiestist&rsquo;s claim that realism and anti-realism eventually breaks down into the same thing. By showing that mind-dependence entities are not a member of the robust realist&rsquo;s world, then they can defeat this. By doing this, they also achieve some direct opposition to realist theories where the domains can invoke opposing views.</p>

<h4 id="1351-__101-introduction__">135:1 <strong>10.1 Introduction</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Realism about mathematics claims that there are mathematical objects, such as numbers, that have mind-independent properties that make these statements true or false (truth-apt).
<ul>
<li>Example: the number two has the property that it is half of four.</li>
<li>These statements seem to be ontologically committed (OC) to mathematical entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition to the numbers we write there are numbers that are not created by human beings.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1501">150:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Thinking in mathematical theories yield two central problems in the philosophy of mathematics:
<ul>
<li><strong>The truth problem:</strong> <em>What is it that makes some mathematical theories true and others false?</em></li>
<li><strong>The necessity problem:</strong> <em>Mathematical theories, if they are true, are not just contingently true but necessarily true. What makes them necessarily true?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1511">151:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Realist&rsquo;s answer to the truth problem:
<ul>
<li><em>A mathematical theory is true if and only if what it says about a class of mathematical objects is really true of them.</em></li>
<li><strong>Q: I don&rsquo;t get how this is straightforward? How would one verify what is &lsquo;really true of them&rsquo;?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1512">151:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>The necessity problem is more difficult:
<ul>
<li><strong>Necessary truth:</strong> a statement is necessarily true if and only if it is true in e very possible world.
<ul>
<li>This is possible if mathematical objects necessarily exist == exist in every possible world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platonism was constructed to deal with the necessity problem.
<ul>
<li>Holds that there is a realm of mathematical objects that is distinct from the physical world (realm of <em>nous</em>, forms and ideas only, archetypal abstract entities).
<ul>
<li>Properties of abstract entities:
<ul>
<li>Eternal/unchanging/transcendental</li>
<li>Not spatio-temporal</li>
<li>Casually inert/non-efficacious</li>
<li>Existing in some kind of abstract, non-physical realm</li>
<li>Known as <em>abstracta</em> and contrasted with <em>concreta</em></li>
<li>Conflicted with <em>Nominalism (there are no abstract entities, we do not have to commit to abstract entities, can be local)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This realm exists in every possible world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1513">151:3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Platonism has epistemological problems.
<ul>
<li><strong>C: I suspect this questions how a Platonist would know such a realm of forms exists while being subjected to the realm of particulars.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternatives: naturalist realism and hybrid realism.</li>
<li><strong>Naturalism: mathematical objects are parts of the natural world.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Burden to solve the necessity problem as it plagues this theory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid realism: some mathematical objects are natural object, some are Platonic objects.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>POSITION: top right</strong></li>
<li>Holds that: <em>either all or some mathematical objects are sets.</em>
<ul>
<li>Natural numbers are discretely ordered.</li>
<li>Rational and real numbers are densely ordered.</li>
<li>A set is a collection of things.</li>
<li>Some sets have subsets.</li>
<li>A sequence is an ordered set.
<ul>
<li>Real numbers require infinite sets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are infinite sets that have infinitely sets larger than itself. These sets are called &ldquo;transfinite sets&rdquo; (Georg Cantor)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1531">153:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Other mathematical objects such as functions, spaces, etc. are also reducible to sets.</li>
<li>The universe of sets became a unified ontology of mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1532">153:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since sets are causally inert, they are different from non-perceptible objects such as subatomic particles.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1533">153:3</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maddy: claims that sets are spatial, they are located in space and are constituents of the natural world.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example: some books in an office also means there is a set of books in that office.</li>
<li>But sets of Platonic things are purely abstract.
<ul>
<li><em>Pure sets: built up from the empty set, such as the set of natural numbers.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1534-1541">153:4 154:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Platonism is ontologically extravagant: It postulates a sort of entity that seems unconnected with the natural world.
<ul>
<li>It is not qualitatively parsimonious — committed to <em>abstracta</em> and <em>concreta</em></li>
<li>It is definitely not quantitatively parsimonious — committed to vast number of abstract entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1542">154:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Platonism is epistemologically difficult: It postulates the existence of some sort of mysterious means by which we know about mathematical entities
<ul>
<li><strong>Benacerraf&rsquo;s Access Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is mysterious as to how we come to acquire mathematical knowledge, since we are not causally connected to mathematical entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gödelian intuition as a solution (flawed)</strong>
<ul>
<li>We have a special direct <strong>intuition</strong> for mathematics that is akin to perception.</li>
<li>Similar solution coming from non-reductive realists about morality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Issues with Gödel&rsquo;s solution</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can the intuition be reliable?</li>
<li>There are no causal relations to connect us with the Platonic realm that justifies our intuition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>
<ul>
<li>It seems like Benacerraf&rsquo;s problem remains for the realist.</li>
<li>It has the form of an attitude problem.
<ul>
<li>(P1) We have abundant knowledge about mathematical facts.</li>
<li>(P2) We cannot possibly have any knowledge of a Platonic realm of mathematical sets.</li>
<li>(C) Therefore, mathematical facts are not reducible to facts about a Platonic realm of sets.</li>

<li>We lay down a set of axioms and the rest of mathematics can be derived from them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1554">155:4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Logicism cannot clear up what makes logical truths self-evident. But we do seem to know some logical truths.</li>
<li>We are making progress by reducing mathematical knowledge to logical knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1561">156:1</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gödel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is always a mathematical truth that is beyond the reaches of proof. Logic is not enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In computers, a logical system is computable if it is of the sort that can be <em>programmed</em> into the computer, or that there is some finite representation that will generate it (proofs cannot be infinitesimally expansive)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1562">156:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Avoid Gödel&rsquo;s problem:

<li>These systems cannot be represented in a finite way.
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Examples? What does this mean?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We cannot survey finite set of axioms to see whether they are self-evident. We cannot be said to know everything about arithmetic.</li>

<li><strong>Q: How does this act as an objection? If logicism is anti-realist then it is an objection. But logicism seems to be neutral about the realist-anti-realist debate.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1564">156:4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some believe that we cannot things into existence.
<ul>
<li>The existence of a thing cannot be a logical truth</li>
<li><strong>C: Not logical equivalence nor conditionally bound.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>Logicist&rsquo;s response to objection:

<li>There are grades of self-evidence.

<li>There are also statements in classical logic that are debatable:

<ul>
<li>A set of mathematical statements wherein contradictions cannot be derived represent a group of mathematical objects.
<ul>
<li>Sufficient condition for existence: if the set of statements about that class of objects is consistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This view is &ldquo;full-blown Platonism&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1572">157:2</h4>
<ul>
<li>What defines consistency?
<ul>
<li>A consistency proof does not require any connection with the entities themselves.</li>
<li>We just need to make sure no contradictions can be followed logically from a set of postulates.</li>
<li>We do not need to prove any consistency, since consistency proofs are often complicated and require more mathematics than what is contained in the theories.</li>
<li>We can instead use relative consistency proofs, <em>x</em> is consistent if <em>y</em> is consistent. However, this has limited epistemological value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since we cannot cover all potential contradictions, nor can we have a useful consistency proof, how does Balaguer defend his modified Platonism?
<ul>
<li>He claims that there is an intuitive notion of consistency.</li>
<li>He does not give details of how we can come to know this.</li>
<li><strong>C: This is a bit more acceptable than Gödel&rsquo;s intuition because we do not need to have intuition about the statements themselves, but only the consistency between them.</strong></li>

</li>
<li>Mathematical theories are thin references.

<ul>
<li>All super sets belong to the same place as their subsets. This can be extended as much as one can and create a mapping or hierarchy of sets, all in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>If a set of things exists whenever those things exist, then in every possible world in which one object exists, a whole hierarchy of sets exists in that world, iff there are no empty worlds.</li>

<h4 id="1592">159:2</h4>

<li>(P2) It is part of our best theory of the world that numbers are properties of sets</li>

<ul>
<li>Platonist&rsquo;s complaint:

<li>We cannot perceive empty or pure sets (sets constructed from empty set).</li>
<li>From Maddy&rsquo;s naturalism, these sets <em>do not exist</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Response:
<ul>
<li>We can reconstruct mathematics without pure sets. Instead of having a special empty set, we can nominate anything that is not a set to be our &ldquo;empty set&rdquo;.</li>
<li>This empty set has no members.</li>
<li>So we can call the eggs as an empty set.</li>
<li>We then have a set of empty sets, one of them being the eggs.</li>
<li>We can perceive the set of the set of egg when we perceive the egg (our perception can work backwards).

<ul>
<li><strong>POSITION: top left</strong></li>
<li>Some mathematical objects are natural and others are Platonic</li>
<li>It is considered a form of naturalism.</li>
<li>Motivation: epistemological.
<ul>
<li>We have causal relations with some mathematical objects.</li>
<li>We can abstract their structures.</li>
<li>We can then make generalisations to justify beliefs about mathematical objects to which we have no direct access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1615">161:5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some <em>structuralists</em> are hybrid realists.</li>
<li><strong>Structuralism: mathematics is not about a particular class of objects, but about the structure of all objects.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>Traditional Platonists think that arithmetic is about a particular sequence of objects (natural numbers).</li>
<li>Structuralists hold that arithmetic is not about any particular sequence of objects, but about anything that has the same structure as the sequence.</li>
<li>Thus arithmetic is considered the same kind of structure as a sequence of abstract objects.</li>
</ul>

<li>This avoids the epistemological problem

<h4 id="1621">162:1</h4>
<ul>
<li>There has to be enough concrete objects to provide all the structures needed for mathematics.
<ul>
<li>This is a structuralist&rsquo;s worry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agree with Platonism that mathematics is necessarily true (and thus truth-apt).
<ul>
<li>Therefore, structuralists have to postulate abstract objects as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resnik &amp; Shapiro:</strong> postulated a <em>sensible</em> realm of sets similar to Platonism.</li>
<li><strong>Bigelow:</strong> postulated that mathematical structures are universals.
<ul>
<li>A universal is a property
<ul>
<li>It can be instantiated by a group of objects (taken on)</li>
<li>Those that are instantiated exist in space and time</li>
<li>Those that are not instantiated exist as Platonic abstract objects</li>

<li>Hybrid realism still has the metaphysical problem. Unless all of them are instantiated, the problem cannot be avoided.
<ul>
<li><strong>C: Depending on how expansive our progress in mathematics is, it is near impossible to discover all the concrete objects to build our mathematical structures on.</strong>
<ul>
<li>What do we abstract and generalise for the structure that complex numbers have?</li>
