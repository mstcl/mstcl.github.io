<p>I <code>ls -a</code> my home directory one morning and found that it is <strong>littered</strong> with <code>.dir</code> and <code>.file</code> from compilers and packages that do not comply with the XDG standards. I did realise that I did not export the variables in my <code>zshrc</code>, so I did that and emptied my home directory pretty well. However, there are quite a few that needed their separate variable, like <code>PACKAGE_XYZ_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.config/xyz/</code>, some even needed alias that points the config directory to the right place. Such atrocity!</p>
<p>Regardless, I followed <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory">this</a> extremely good resource that allowed me to de-clutter the <code>~/</code> directory extensively.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-remember">Things to remember</h2>
<p>I have to edit LightDM root config according to <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/960793/whats-the-right-place-to-set-the-xauthority-environment-variable/961459#961459">this</a> in order to get rid of <code>.Xauthority</code></p>
