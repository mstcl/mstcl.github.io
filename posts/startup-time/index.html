			<h2 id="neovim">Neovim</h2>
<p>I tried to configure Neovim&rsquo;s plugins using Packer as opposed to using Vim-plug. I found out that it is easier to lazy-load plugins, so I tried to lazy-load as many as I can. I currently have <del>38</del> 41 plugins, and so far only two of them are not lazy-loaded, as doing so messed things up no matter what I tried. By doing <code>#!bash nvim --startuptime /path/to/file</code>, it is reported that my Neovim takes <del>71</del> 64 ms to load the screen, pretty good considering I have a lot of plugins.</p>
<h2 id="zsh">ZSH</h2>
<p>I removed <code>miniconda</code> and I might try using pyenv instead because whatever conda tried to initialise in my <code>zshrc</code> takes up 60 ms. I removed those lines added by conda and when doing <code>time zsh -i -c exit</code>, I only see a total of 20 ms now. Pretty magical, I&rsquo;m also not using any bloated zsh <em>configuration</em> like oh-my-zsh, because I used to and it added a plethora of aliases I never use and get confused by. I took my time to configure my <code>zshrc</code> properly and now it feels much faster! Instead of using <code>compinit</code>, I&rsquo;m currently using <code>fzf</code> instead, my setup includes fzf fuzzy searching + syntax-highlighting + auto-suggest + zoxide as an autojump replacement. I can tell you that my shell feels pretty and powerful.</p>
