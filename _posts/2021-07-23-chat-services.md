Here's a fact; There are simply too many chat services, it's splitting my
brain. Quick breakdown of the ones I use (forced to use):

## Discord

Just as any other zoomer out there, I use Discord as primary communication with
my friends, and most of popular public servers. It stores your chat logs in
plain text and probably sells your data. I don't know, it sucks but it's
popular. I sometimes have to use mumble while gaming for VC because it's
literally a browser taking up almost a gigabyte of RAM. Inb4 "download more
ram".

What I do instead. I use an e2ee plugin through BetterDiscord called Apote.
There's also SimpleDiscordCrypt but it's unmaintained and pretty dead. On my
Android phone I just use Insular to create a work profile and use Aliucord in
that profile instead.

## Telegram

There are a few interest groups here but I use the Saved Messages to literally
backup my images and send myself links so I can check them out on another
device. I keep recipes this way. I use the K web version and Nekogram on
Android.

## Matrix

Matrix is promising, but no one I know uses it. The bridges are cool, but I'd
rather run full irc to keep it simple. I use Fluffychat on all platforms.

### Side note

I followed [this

below to integrate Libera into Matrix.

## Whatsapp

I live in Europe and Whatsapp is used by virtually everyone here. It's for uni
groups, housemates, etc., but you gotta admit it's e2ee (or so they claim).
The backdoors shouldn't affect me because I don't send or receive CP and I
always remember to send "Good morning" texts and images to those I love
(honestly this joke makes no sense and is not funny if you're not a Mental
Outlaw fan)! I use Whatsapp through Insular on Android, and set up
Multi-device so I can have it in my browser (Librewolf, dedicated Facebook
container) without my phone around.

## Instagram/Messenger/ a.k.a other irrelevant Facebook platforms

Let's be real, who calls them Meta? I have messenger and Instagram for some old
friends, like really really old, think middle school and primary. I probably
open those websites once a year at this point. Update: Barinsta got a C&D, I
kept on using it, they locked my Instagram, probably will only give it back to
me if I give up my personal info like face/id/phone number. I am not doing that
in a million years. It's a toxic platform anyway and I couldn't care less.
I'm much happier now. RIP Barinsa.
