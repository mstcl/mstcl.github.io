## Say hello to hblock

I am now using [hblock](https://github.com/hectorm/hblock) and it seems to be really great at managing `/etc/hosts`. To put simply, I have a template with my hostname and localhost, and then a `sources.list` file with StevenBlack master hostfile. Hblock essentially appends the StevenBlack's hostfile to the template and then move it to `/etc/hosts`.
