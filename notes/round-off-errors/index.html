<blockquote>
<p>Since e^-20^ is a very small number and each term in the series can be rather large (of the order of 10^8^,it is clear that other terms as large as 10^8^, but negative, must cancel the figures in front of the decimal point and some behind as well. Since a computer can only hold a fixed number of significant figures, all those in front of the decimal point are not only useless, they are crowding out needed figures at the right end of the number. Unless we are very careful we will find ourselves adding up series that finally consists entirely of round off errors! An analysis of the contribution to the sum from various terms shows that the relative error made can be huge. This results in an unstable computation, since small errors made at one stage are magnified in subsequent stages.</p>
