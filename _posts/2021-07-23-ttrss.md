## Local-hosting

So I'm hosting a Tiny Tiny RSS locally (LAN-only) and it works great, the web-ui is so damn slick with [awesome-ttrss](https://ttrss.henry.wang/)

On the phone I am using the default app on f-droid and although there is no inline reading mode, it still works pretty well, all articles will have to be saved offline once I leave my house.

## To get it running on my PC:

```bash
cd $HOME/docker/rss
docker-compose up -d
```

## Update

I stopped this now due to being unable to host it. I'm currently using newsboat on my pc and Feeder on my phone. They're not sync but I don't mind.
