      <title>From Vimwiki to plain Markdown</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m changing I have been using a combination of vimwiki and Mkdocs inside neovim for a while now, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really satisified with the outcome. Although Mkdocs with the material theme is extremely feature-packed (python markdown extensions are really good), I feel like rejecting bloat and returning to simplicity is better for blogging/journalling/organising in general. Mkdocs was made with slick documentions in mind so the javascript was annoying me quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Migration Moving from yay to paru, I discovered a few useful commands that existed in yay that I never bothered checking out.
Cheatsheet Below is a snippet from my zshrc showing my paru aliases and their tldr:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  alias pu=&amp;#39;paru -Syu&amp;#39; #sync &amp;amp; upgrade alias pusu=&amp;#39;paru -Syu --noconfirm&amp;#39; #sync &amp;amp; upgrade w/o confirmation alias pfetch=&amp;#39;paru -Ps&amp;#39; #display stats alias pcom=&amp;#39;paru -Gc&amp;#39; #display comments alias pnews=&amp;#39;paru -Pw&amp;#39; #display news alias pid=&amp;#39;paru -U&amp;#39; #install from local file(s) alias pir=&amp;#39;paru -S&amp;#39; #install from repositories alias pnd=&amp;#39;paru -Qi&amp;#39; #display info from database alias pnr=&amp;#39;paru -Si&amp;#39; #display info from repositories alias pfd=&amp;#39;paru -Qs&amp;#39; #search in database alias pfr=&amp;#39;paru -Ss&amp;#39; #search in repositories alias pls=&amp;#39;paru -Q&amp;#39; #list packages installed alias plsa=&amp;#39;paru -Qea&amp;#39; #list packages explicitly installed alias porf=&amp;#39;paru -Qdt&amp;#39; #list orphaned packages alias pcc=&amp;#39;paru -Scd&amp;#39; #interactive cache removal   FZF integration I also found that defining an installing and removing function which uses FZF to crawl through the local database is great.</description>

      <description>XDG_Base_Directory crisis I ls -a my home directory one morning and found that it is littered with .dir and .file from compilers and packages that do not comply with the XDG standards. I did realise that I did not export the variables in my zshrc, so I did that and emptied my home directory pretty well. However, there are quite a few that needed their separate variable, like PACKAGE_XYZ_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.config/xyz/, some even needed alias that points the config directory to the right place.</description>

      <description>Motivation I wanted a simple and creative way to manage my dotfiles, one which would allow more automation than my previous method. I stumbled upon many existing tools that can be utilised to manage dotfiles, such as GNU Stow and chezmoi. But they all seem to be too overkill for me, and their management method do not float my boat quite that well. Here&amp;rsquo;s what these tools might envision a ~/dotfiles or ~/.</description>

      <description>Utility I am now using hblock and it seems to be really great at managing /etc/hosts. To put simply, I have a template with my hostname and localhost, and then a sources.list file with StevenBlack master hostfile. Hblock essentially appends the StevenBlack&amp;rsquo;s hostfile to the template and then move it to /etc/hosts.</description>

      <description>Experience  I wanted to make a custom cheatsheet with all my custom bindings, (update 24/08: after constantly forcing myself to look up ways to do things without just going jjj or kkkk or whatever repetitive motions you would normally do, I&amp;rsquo;m a much better vim user now) I assigned ; to : a while ago, but I moved to &amp;lt;space&amp;gt;. While it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to change my muscle memory, it means since my leader key is ,, I can have the sequence ++comma+semicolon++ executing &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;  this removes the need for my small pinky to travel far to reach the actual escape key    Recently learned bindings  f(x) jumps to next x on the line  there is also ++t++ which does the same but jumps to the place preceding the x lower-case variants go forward and upper-case variants go backwards ; repeats the latest jump command, can be extended $n$ times    Plugins  which key zen  autosession symbols kommentary suda neoscroll replaces smoothie maximizer spaceless  </description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a qualm: there are simply too many chat services, it&amp;rsquo;s splitting my brain
 discord as primary communication with my boyfriend, some of my friends, and most of popular public servers  discord + e2ee @ browser for main discord &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android for main discord electron + betterdiscord integrations @ linux for alt, only for calling my boyfriend   telegram with my parents &amp;amp; lingering privacy-centric groups, or android modding groups  nekogram x @ android telegram k web @ browser   matrix (with libera bridge) for most public groups that are worthy enough to use the protocol, mainly privacy-focussed group and tech-related  fluffychat @ android mirage @ linux   whatsapp for absolute normies (uni groups, housemates, most irl boomers)  whatsapp &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android whatsapp web @ browser but cookies are not saved   messenger/facebook/instagram for some old friends, but I probably open those websites once a year at this point  barinsta &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; insular @ android with chat function web versions @ browser but again, I simply avoid using it    Internet guide I followed this link below to integrate libera.</description>

      <description>Local-hosting So I&amp;rsquo;m hosting a Tiny Tiny RSS locally (LAN-only) and it works great, the web-ui is so damn slick with awesome-ttrss
On the phone I am using the default app on f-droid and although there is no inline reading mode, it still works pretty well, all articles will have to be saved offline once I leave my house
To get it running on my box: 1 2  cd $HOME/docker/rss docker-compose up -d   </description>

      <description>Self-hosting  I sucesfully setup a docker container that is self-hosting bitwarden locally. I cannot expose the server so locally should be ideal still since I&amp;rsquo;m not going out as much or doing anything which requires instantaneous syncing. my passwords now contain a single point of failure, and that is my physical computer, if anything were to happen to the data on my nvme, then my passwords are screwed but hey, at least my passwords are not lingering somewhere on a centralised server that is very attractive to those with malicious intents I&amp;rsquo;m not important anyway, who would want to attack my local data?</description>

      <description>Page 27, paragraph 2, line 8-17  Since e^-20^ is a very small number and each term in the series can be rather large (of the order of 10^8^,it is clear that other terms as large as 10^8^, but negative, must cancel the figures in front of the decimal point and some behind as well. Since a computer can only hold a fixed number of significant figures, all those in front of the decimal point are not only useless, they are crowding out needed figures at the right end of the number.</description>

      <description>Question What on earth is a non-conservative force if all underlying forces of friction and other contact forces operate as conservative force on a microsopic level?
This one partially answers my question here
Hint: Mechanical energy is the keyword.
Another answer from stackexchange: Q: &amp;ldquo;How do many conservative forces come together to make a non-conservative one?&amp;rdquo; So my question how do several different Electromagnetic forces come together to make a new frictional force which is non-conservative in nature</description>

      <description>Note to self Maybe it will help reduce the anxiety surrounding this aspect of my life. I have been struggling every time a move comes up, this usually involves flying back home from school abroad, or simply just packing up alone. I hate possessions, I hate going through them and feeling wasteful if I throw them away, but simply giving them away sometimes require too much effort. I would do it if it were to be more accessible.</description>

      <description> unit: steradian (sr) analogous to plane angle, which is defined by arc length and radius, but unlike the plane angle, it is defined by the surface area of a sphere subtended by the lines and by the radius of that sphere (squared, for a correct dimensional analysis.  $\theta = \frac{l}{dr}$ $\Omega = \frac{a}{r^2}$ unlike the plane angle, it cannot be conceived of without reference to an arbitrary sphere.  this was a pretty intuitive and sympathetic explanation      </description>

      <description>Vectors Notations  the basis is the set of unit vectors from which all others are built perpendicular axes normally have basis vectors $\boldsymbol{\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}}$  helpful to remember: i = 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock, j = 4 o&amp;rsquo;clock, k = 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock (standard) this is right-handed axes (anti-clockwise)   $\boldsymbol{\hat{a}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{a}}{\left|a\right|}$  Components  $\theta$ taken from x-axis  $a_x = a\cos{\theta}$ $a_y = a\sin{\theta}$ $\tan{\theta} = \frac{a_y}{a_x}$ $\left|a\right| = \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2}$   3D components  pretty much compliant with 2D and 1D examples, but the concept of an e might be harder to visualise, we rely on the unit vectors as it&amp;rsquo;s a much easier system.</description>
