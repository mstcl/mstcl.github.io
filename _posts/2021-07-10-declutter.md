## A note to self

Maybe it will help reduce the anxiety surrounding this aspect of my life. I have been struggling every time a move comes up, this usually involves flying back home from school abroad, or simply just packing up alone. I hate possessions, I hate going through them and feeling wasteful if I throw them away, but simply giving them away sometimes require too much effort. I would do it if it were to be more accessible. This time round, it should be easy to donate most things, but I would still have to discard a few things, unfortunately.
