      <description>Question What on earth is a non-conservative force if all underlying forces of friction and other contact forces operate as conservative force on a microsopic level?
This one partially answers my question here
Hint: Mechanical energy is the keyword.
Another answer from stackexchange: Q: &amp;ldquo;How do many conservative forces come together to make a non-conservative one?&amp;rdquo; So my question how do several different Electromagnetic forces come together to make a new frictional force which is non-conservative in nature</description>

      <description>dot product  perpendicular/orthogonal components are 0  $\hat{i} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{k} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{i}$ and so on and so forth    vector product  I generally find the right hand rule to be very straight forward  index $\times$ middle = thumb    </description>

      <description>The Cartesian body  motion of a body is a change of relation to the bodies that surround it. concept of inertia  a body&amp;rsquo;s motion wil be preserved unless caused to deviate from its path so not a function of its spatial relations to other bodies but of its causal relation    The Newtonian body  a body&amp;rsquo;s motion is not a function of its spatial relations to other objects but rather of whether forces are impressed on it.</description>

      <description>Vectors Notations  the basis is the set of unit vectors from which all others are built perpendicular axes normally have basis vectors $\boldsymbol{\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}}$  helpful to remember: i = 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock, j = 4 o&amp;rsquo;clock, k = 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock (standard) this is right-handed axes (anti-clockwise)   $\boldsymbol{\hat{a}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{a}}{\left|a\right|}$  Components  $\theta$ taken from x-axis  $a_x = a\cos{\theta}$ $a_y = a\sin{\theta}$ $\tan{\theta} = \frac{a_y}{a_x}$ $\left|a\right| = \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2}$   3D components  pretty much compliant with 2D and 1D examples, but the concept of an e might be harder to visualise, we rely on the unit vectors as it&amp;rsquo;s a much easier system.</description>
