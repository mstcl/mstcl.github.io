Here's a fact; There are simply too many chat services, it's splitting my brain. Quick breakdown of the ones I use (forced to use):

## Discord

Just as any other zoomer out there, I use Discord as primary communication with my friends, and most of popular public servers. It stores your chat logs in plain text and probably sells your data. I don't know, it sucks but it's popular. I sometimes have to use mumble while gaming for VC because it's literally a browser taking up almost a gigabyte of RAM. Inb4 "download more ram".

Update (Jan 06 2022)

What I do instead. I use an e2ee plugin through BetterDiscord called Apote. There's also SimpleDiscordCrypt but it's unmaintained and pretty dead. On my Android phone I just use Insular to create a work profile and use Discord in that profile instead.

## Telegram

There are a few interest groups here but I use the Saved Messages to literally backup my images and send myself links so I can check them out on another device. I keep recipes this way. I use the K web version and Nekogram on Android.

## Matrix

Matrix is promising, but no one I know uses it. The bridges are cool, but I'd rather run full irc to keep it simple. I use Fluffychat on all platforms.

### Side note

I followed [this link](https://kparal.wordpress.com/2021/06/01/connecting-to-libera-chat-through-matrix/) below to integrate libera.chat into Matrix.

## Whatsapp

I live in Europe and Whatsapp is used by virtually everyone here. It's for absolute normies (my uni groups, housemates, most boomers I know), but you gotta admit it's e2ee (or so they claim). The backdoors shouldn't affect me because I don't send or receive CP and always remember to send "Good morning" texts and images to those you love! I use Whatsapp through Insular on Android, and set up Multi-device so I can have it in my browser (Librewolf, dedicated Facebook container) without my phone around.

## Instagram/Messenger/ a.k.a other irrelevant Facebook platforms

Let's be real, who calls them Meta? I have messenger and Instagram for some old friends, like really really old, think middle school and primary. I probably open those websites once a year at this point. Update: Barinsta got a C&D, I kept on using it, they locked my Instagram, probably will only give it back to me if I give up my personal info like face/id/phone number. I am not doing that so bye bye Instagram. It's a toxic platform anyway and I couldn't care less. I'm much happier now. RIP Barinsa.
