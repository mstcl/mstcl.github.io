Today, just 8 days from the start of my first semester exams, I decided to redo my blog/personal site. I was using Hugo before, and my previous post was _indeed_ about using Hugo. Today I moved to Jekyll, because it integrates well with Github Pages.

I considered neocities, since it seems so nostalgic and gives off a Tumblr vibe, albeit more mature. Don't expect anything mature here though. I like to shitpost from time to time.

This is my first post here, and hopefully it'll motivate me to write more. I have removed random uni notes from here, and the _zettelkasten_ system hasn't really worked for me since I can type into a search engine (Searx ftw!) faster than I can recall which zettle I wanted to open and what it was called. 

There's not much more to say, I just have to create a new git repo, replace the old one with this one, and finally commit and push when I'm done migrating.

Currently typing on nicely broken in Cherry blacks, it's 11:30 pm and Neovim is comfy af. Adios!
