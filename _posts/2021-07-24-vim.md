## Experience

I wanted to make a custom cheatsheet with all my **custom** bindings, (update 24/08: after constantly forcing myself to look up ways to do things without just going jjj or kkkk or whatever repetitive motions you would normally do, I'm a much better vim user now)

I assigned `;` to `:` a while ago, but I moved to `<space>`. While it's been hard to change my muscle memory, it means since my **leader** key is `,`, I can have the sequence `comma+semicolon` executing `<esc>`. This removes the need for my small pinky to travel far to reach the actual escape key.

### Update Aug 25 2021

I used `,.` as leader for a while, but now I am back to `,`. I am using a plugin called [Better Escape](https://github.com/jdhao/better-escape.vim) and while it is not written in Lua, it means I can do `jk` quickly to escape insert mode.

## Recently learned things

- `f[x]` jumps to next `x` on the line
  - there is also `t` which does the same but jumps to the place preceding the `x`
- `F` is like `f`, but it goes backwards instead, same goes for `T`.
  - `;` repeats the latest jump command, `,` repeats in the opposite direction
  - However, since my leader key is `,`, I am using a plugin called Lightspeed to navigate, and it uses something similar to Clever F.
- `<C-A>` to increment number under cursor and `<C-X>` to decrement number under cursor
- `:123,345s/<from>/<to>/g` will do search and replace for those lines
- `J` to append next line to current line, can be dotted repeated however many lines with `5.`.
- `<C-o>` to enter normal mode only and re-enter insert mode after one movement.
