<p>I have been using a combination of vimwiki and Mkdocs inside <a href="/posts/vim/">neovim</a> for a while now, but I&rsquo;m not really satisified with the outcome. Although Mkdocs with the material theme is extremely feature-packed (python markdown extensions are <em>really</em> good), I feel like rejecting bloat and returning to simplicity is better for blogging/journalling/organising in general. Mkdocs was made with slick documentions in mind so the javascript was annoying me quite a bit.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>I looked up SSG and found Hugo to be easy to use, I have yet to deploy a Github page with it and archive my Mkdocs repository, but once I do it, it will feel like a proper personal blog!</p>
<p>In terms of neovim, I will replace vimwiki with a good markdown syntax plugin because the built-in one is hot doo-doo. This means I won&rsquo;t need vim-zettel as well, and instead of using any plugins, I will just manage my page with <code>hugo &lt;command&gt;</code> instead. But good syntax-highlighting and font-formatting is what I&rsquo;m looking for. Following links can be done with <code>gf</code> and fuzzy search or live_grep for it with telescope.nvim</p>
<p>Anyway, this would be my first post created with hugo&rsquo;s built-in commands.</p>
